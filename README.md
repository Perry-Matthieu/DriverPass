Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a business that wanted to sell drivers education. The system needed was a storefront and test/course delivery system.

What did you do particularly well?

Describing the flow of data and system operation in non-technical words.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would add more description to the class diagram and I would add more security features to the diagrams.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The owner provided a basic interfrace design and I have incorporated most aspects of that design into the system design. It is important to consider user needs when designing the system because the goal of the system is to meet the client needs. If the client isnt happy with the end design then the developement process served no purpose.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My first step in the design process is to understand the most basic functionality requirements. After the baseline requirements are established I take it one step further and break down the how of those requirements. Third I deturmine how all the peaces fit together and create a class diagram and deturmine appropriate methods for each class.
